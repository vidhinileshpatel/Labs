Use three different classifiers to classify a celestial entity as
a STAR, GALAXY, or QUASAR given only information on the light emitted by
said entity.

Here is the data:

You are going to have to:

1. Grab the data from the internet.
2. Load the data into a Pandas Dataframe.
3. Segment the data into to training and test partitions.
4. Fit 3 models to the data, and use Mean Squared Error to evaluate
which model did the best.
5. Adjust hyperparameters to further optimize each model. (i.e.
adjust neural network layer sizes.)

*NOTE:* A MSE of 0.126 is definitely possible.
